Onsight 2, 6.

Fell/hung 3,4,7

P1: fingercrack is less than vertical. Lock and smear and you’re by a wide margin strong enough to get to the hand jam/stem rest at top of fingers

Incinerator: STAY TIGHT! climb fast and find finger locks to place. Cannot sow it up. Pull hips into wall to place. Would a right leg Drop knee work?? Climbing is easy, placing is strenuous. Good hand jams and a .75 near top of crack

Boulder problem: right hand undercling, right foot jam, left hand palm press, left foot edge -> left foot onto arete, trust it, right foot onto sloper below undercling, right hand Gaston undercling, stand up to jug

Pitch 5: hidden jug at most awkward part, right before thin hands/overhang (in the hole, can’t see before committing)
