TODO: REMAINING STEPS
 0. data - filter out only ROCK CLIMBING and BOULDERING. No ice, snow slogs, mixed, etcetera
 1. data - filter out to only previous quarter and create a separate csv for this file
 2. Logging to txt file

 TODO: FUTURE STEPS
 1. Use machine learning to predict what grades of routes, types of climbs, number of pitches, etc; that the user is going to do in the next month. Send this the day before their results come 
 2. Update plotly html files to be Dash dashboards. Host my own data on my own website

Additional Graph Ideas
- TODO: average route grade/pitches climbed by style (trad, sport, boulder, multipitch) quarter by quarter (track improvement/regression) - Essentially period to period comparison
- Word cloud taken from notes
